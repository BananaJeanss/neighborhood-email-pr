## Wait what's neighborhood

ðŸ¦• WHY DID THE ORPHEUS CROSS THE ROAD?!
ðŸ¥³ TO MAKE IT TO NEIGHBORHOOD THIS SUMMER!

This Summer, we're launching our first ever guaranteed housing program, Neighborhood (#neighborhood) ðŸŒ‰
If you spend 100 hours this May making your own app, you're guaranteed a flight stipend to & housing in San Francisco this Summer (June - August) ðŸ”¥
There's no capacity limit or selection process. Every week in San Francisco, you will ship a project with the Hack Clubbers you meet over the summer. ðŸš¢
-> https://neighborhood.hackclub.com/

I'll see you on the kickoff call Friday May 9th 7:30 PM EST ðŸ“†
(RSVP by signing up on the site)
